# ZIG WHEELS – USED CARS Data Analysis using Python

I'm sharing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization of the data from Used Cars in Zig Wheels website  using Python - A Data Analysis Project performed in my journey into Data Science.

# About ZigWheels:

Zigwheels is the best car & bike research app in India to buy, sell and compare cars and bikes, be it new or used. It gives you in-depth information, price alerts and offers about new cars, used cars, new motorcycles and scooters. You can compare any two cars or any two bikes to decide which car or bike to buy.

# About the Project:

The data that we are going to use in this example is about cars. Specifically containing various information datapoints about the used cars, like their price, color, etc. Here we need to understand that simply collecting data isn’t enough. Raw data isn’t useful. Here data analysis plays a vital role in unlocking the            information that we require and to gain new insights into this raw data.
        
        
For a private buyer or seller who are new to the used-car market, a common confusion is about what to be expected. Therefore, this project attempts to provide a used-car evaluation service based on the on-line listing information. The objective of the project is to discuss the features of used-car with regard to its influence on the market price.
        
        
The final product takes features (Brand, Model, Price, Fuel Type, Km_run, year_model.) of a used-car as input and output a prediction of price. Moreover, it should be capable of producing an interval prediction as price range, and it should be able to handle missing features so that the user can make a query even when they are not clear about certain feature.
